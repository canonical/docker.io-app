# Restart Docker if it's running (thus this is an upgrade) and the user (via
# debconf) tells us they're OK with that.
#
# The snippet below is supposed to be in a config maintscript but it is not
# because of the following:
#
## When a package is installed in the system, dpkg-preconfigure (*not*
## dpkg-reconfigure) is invoked.  If the package has debconf templates *and* a
## .config file, then dpkg-preconfigure executes the .config script which
## ultimately asks the debconf questions to the user.  Then, later in the
## installation process, when the postinst script is executed, the config script
## is once again invoked.  You might think "wait, won't that mean that the user
## will get asked the same question(s) twice?!", and you would be right!  That's
## one of the reasons why debconf keeps track of whether the questions have been
## asked already (the "seen" flag in the database).
##
## docker.io manipulates this "seen" flag (see the "db_fset" call below) in
## order to make sure that the user will always get asked the restart question
## during package upgrades.  If we leave this code inside the postinst script
## and get rid of the config script, then the question only gets asked once
## because dpkg-preconfigure won't find a config script and won't invoke
## debconf.  But if you move this code into a proper config script, the question
## gets asked twice during upgrades/reinstalls.
