"If Docker is upgraded without restarting the Docker daemon, Docker will "
"often have trouble starting new containers, and in some cases even "
"maintaining the containers it is currently running. See https://launchpad."
"net/bugs/1658691 for an example of this breakage."

"Normally, upgrading the package would simply restart the associated "
"daemon(s). In the case of the Docker daemon, that would also imply stopping "
"all running containers (which will only be restarted if they're part of a "
"\"service\", have an appropriate restart policy configured, or have some "
"other means of being restarted such as an external systemd unit)."
