.SH NAME
docker-login - Authenticate to a registry


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdocker login [OPTIONS] [SERVER]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
Log in to a Docker Registry located on the specified
\fBSERVER\fR\&.  You can specify a URL or a \fBhostname\fR for the \fBSERVER\fR value. If you
do not specify a \fBSERVER\fR, the command uses Docker's public registry located at
\fBhttps://registry-1.docker.io/\fR by default.  To get a username/password for Docker's public registry, create an account on Docker Hub.

.PP
\fBdocker login\fR requires user to use \fBsudo\fR or be \fBroot\fR, except when:
.IP "  1." 5
connecting to  a remote daemon, such as a \fBdocker-machine\fR provisioned \fBdocker engine\fR\&.
.IP "  2." 5
user is added to the \fBdocker\fR group.  This will impact the security of your system; the \fBdocker\fR group is \fBroot\fR equivalent.  See Docker Daemon Attack Surface
\[la]https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#docker\-daemon\-attack\-surface\[ra] for details.

.PP
You can log into any public or private repository for which you have
credentials.  When you log in, the command stores encoded credentials in
\fB$HOME/.docker/config.json\fR on Linux or \fB%USERPROFILE%/.docker/config.json\fR on Windows.
