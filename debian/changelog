docker.io-app (24.0.5-0ubuntu1) mantic; urgency=medium

  * Update the way MUT are pre-processed and imported.
    - d/get-orig-source.sh: create a script to be called by uscan when
      importing a new version. This script is going to fetch all the needed
      components and combine all the tarballs into a single one.
    - d/helpers/{real,tini}-upstream-version.sh: create helper scripts to
      support the d/get-orig-source.sh. They process the upstream version of
      differente components.
    - d/watch: update to track just github.com/moby/moby which is the main
      component of this package, the others are now tracked and fetched by
      d/get-orig-source.sh.
  * New upstream version 24.0.5.
  * The libnetwork component is now shipped inside the engine component.
    - d/rules: update to build proxy from the new path.
    - d/docker.io.docs: do not install NOTICE from the removed libnetwork
      component.
    - d/copyright: remove all entries for libnetwork component.
  * Build CLI manpages before build time to avoid downloading modules from the
    Internet.
    - d/docker.io.manpages: install manpages from debian/manpages.
    - d/helpers/build-manpages.sh: create a wrapper for the upstream script
      to generate manpages and place them in the expected directory.
    - d/rules: do not try to build manpage during build time, instead, check
      if the manpages version matches with the upstream one.
  * Create debian/manpages with debian/helpers/build-manpages.sh.
  * Do not override dh_strip, it works fine with Go binaries nowadays.
    - d/docker.io.lintian-overrides: remove unneeded overrides.
    - d/rules: do not override dh_strip.
  * d/control: use arch:any instead of hard-coded arches.
    The list already contains all the supported architectures in all
    supported releases (non-ESM).
  * d/control: suggests docker-buildx and docker-compose-v2.
  * d/README.source: document how to import a new upstream release.
  * Build with Go 1.20. Let's rely on a fixed version for all supported
    releases.
    - d/control: b-d on golang-1.20-go instead of golang-go.
    - d/rules: add Go 1.20 to $PATH.
  * d/docker.io.lintian-overrides: ignore statically-linked-binary.
    This is not a problem for Go binaries.
